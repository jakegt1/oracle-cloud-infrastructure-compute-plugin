Checking this box indicates that you have authorized an instance to make API calls in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services using the Instance Principals functionality.

After you set up the required resources and policies in OCI, an application running on an instance can call OCI public services, removing the need to configure user credentials or a configuration file.
If you set up this functionality in your Jenkins controller, and check this option, only the <strong>Tenant ID</strong> and <strong>Region</strong> fields are required, while Fingerprint, API Key, Passphrase, and User ID are ignored.

<strong> If this box is checked, it is strongly recommended that you click the Verify Credentials button on the lower right of this page. </strong>

  See 
  <a href="https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/callingservicesfrominstances.htm">Calling Services from an Instance</a>
  documentation for additional information.
